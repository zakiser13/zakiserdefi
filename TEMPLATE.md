## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: NodeLink
- **Category**: infrastructure

### Description
NodeLink is a decentralized infrastructure layer that makes it easy for developers to access and manage blockchain nodes across multiple networks. It solves the problem of fragmented and unreliable RPC endpoints by providing a Soundness Layer (SL)-verified, decentralized node marketplace where developers can:

Request verified RPC access
Monitor reliability and uptime
Pay node providers in a trustless way
This helps dApps scale without depending on centralized RPC providers.

### SL Integration  
NodeLink integrates with the Soundness Layer to:
Verify node provider reliability and data correctness using SL’s consensus proofs.
Ensure transparent service-level guarantees.
Enable SL-based payments and staking for node operators.

## Technical

### Architecture
dApp frontend where developers can browse/select node providers.
Smart contracts on SL for service agreements, staking, and payments.
Off-chain monitoring service that feeds into SL for data verification.
Node providers connect their infra through a lightweight SDK.
### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind
- **Backend**: Rust (for monitoring agent) + Node.js (API gateway) 
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer + Ethereum/Cosmos chains
- **Storage**: WALRUS (for logs), IPFS (for provider metadata)

### Features
1. Decentralized node marketplace with SL-verified metrics
2. Smart contract–based service agreements and payments
3. Monitoring dashboard with reliability scoring

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [Node provider SDK (basic RPC relay) ] Basic functionality
- [SL smart contract for staking/payment ] SL integration
- [Simple dashboard UI ] Simple UI

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [Full monitoring + SL data verification] Full features
- [Provider reliability scoring ] Production ready
- [User testing with first node operators ] User testing

## Innovation
Unlike traditional node providers, NodeLink offers verifiable and trustless guarantees for uptime and reliability. By integrating SL, it prevents “black-box” RPC issues and builds an open marketplace where developers and providers interact transparently.
